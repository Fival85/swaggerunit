# SwaggerUnit
SwaggerUnit is a framework that can be used for the validation of service requests and responses against a swagger definition.

Currently under construction and will be changed to English as the main language.
Further information will then be provided in this Readme.

# ideas
- [FEATURE] A simple Integration-Suite (adapter.classic) for plain java applications unit-tests (after refactoring above!) 
- [FEATURE] More configuration of the validation level. So i hope a not existing parameter could be an error, and instead of ignoring all not existing urls, there should be an blacklist of urls to ignore, so the developer must be decide to ignore an url.
# Todos
- [UDDATE] Update the attlasian request validator framework
